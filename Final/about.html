                <h2>WHO DO WE HELP?</h2>
                <hr>Lily's List works with pediatric patients that have a need for home health nursing. No matter what
                the need, we work to ensure the hospital-to-home transition is as smooth as possible. Our demographic
                ranges from birth to 18.

                <h2>WHAT DO WE PROVIDE?</h2>
                <hr>Lily's List provides a box of supplies for children who have home health nursing. This box of
                supplies is called the "Love Box". These supplies are items our board has deemed as essential in the
                home health lifestyle.

                <h2>HOW DOES LILY'S LIST HELP?</h2>
                <hr>There are two ways families receive assistance through us: direct contact or through their home
                health nursing provider. If their provider is already partnered with us, then the provider can contact
                us to have a box put together for each family. If the patient's nursing provider is not partnered with
                us, we welcome the family to contact us directly through the Parent Portal.
